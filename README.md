## What this is
The Runtboard is a custom keyboard that I designed and coded. It has 83 keys, 2 encoders, 17 LEDs, and an OLED SSD1306 screen. I designed it to have a split keyboard style with keys split down the middle but intentionally left it stuck together to have easier firmware.\
\
I spent a total of rougly 70 hours on this project, from intial designs, pcb, case, and finally firmware. Before reaching this final design, I went through about 3 different variations going back and forth with the pcb and case.\
The Runtboard has 2 layers, one with your regular keyboard layout and one that changes the functions of the encoders. I hope you like the design and you are free to make it yourself if you have a big enough 3d printer.

## Schematic
### Here are the images for my schematic

The header pins are there to make it easier for my wires to reach the pico without having to do funny stuff with the routing and microcontroller. It in a way gives me a third layer to use for connections, which made my life way easier when designing this board.

### The Matrix
You may notice that my matrix looks a bit funny. This is because I overcomplicated it in order to give myself an extra 2 pins to use. By removing 8 columns and adding 6 rows, I gave myself an extra 2 pins that I used to add an extra encoder.

## PCB
### Here are images for my pcb

This is what my pcb looks like. It has a basic silkscreen but i drew all of it on kicad no figma or anything.

On my silkscreen i have bob, the decapitated stick figure. I also have a bunch of anime references and some plugs of my socials and stuff. You should join #taran-does-stupid-things btw. its super cool. run /Darren in slack to join


## Case
I spent a lot of time designing my case(upward of 40 hours) and hope you like the design.
